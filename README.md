# Keychat APP

> Keychat is a chat app, built on [Bitcoin Ecash](https://cashu.space/), [Nostr Protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips), [Signal Protocol](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal) and [MLS Protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/).

## Download

- [Android APK](https://github.com/keychat-io/keychat-app/releases)
- iOS: Comming

## Inspiration

Keychat is inspired by the postal system â€” stamps, post offices, letters.
Keychat uses Bitcoin ecash as stamps and Nostr relays as post offices.

## About Keychat

- Senders send messages stamped with Bitcoin ecash to Nostr relays. The Nostr relays collect the Bitcoin ecash, then deliver messages to receivers.
- Unlike the centralized postal system, Keychat can use multiple Bitcoin ecash issuers and Nostr relays, each maintained by distinct operators.
- Keychat uses Signal protocol to ensure message encryption security and meta-data privacy.
- The content of the letter can be exposed easily by opening the envelope. Keychat messages are end-to-end encrypted via Signal protocol, with a unique encryption key generated for each message. Only the sender and receiver can decrypt the message.
- The addresses of both parties on the envelope can be tracked. In theory, this problem is solved if they change addresses daily. So Keychat reuses Signal protocol to update sending and receiving addresses for nearly every message.
- Like the postal system, Keychat requires no registration. Users just generate Nostr keys as ID.

## Getting Started

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

melos bootstrap

cd packages/app

flutter run

melos run build:android # build apk to release
```


## Based On

- [Nostr Protocol](https://nostr.com/): for delivering and storing messages.
- [Ecash Cashu](https://cashu.space/): for paying micropayments to relays (optional), depends on whether relay charges a fee.
- [Signal Protocol](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal): for encrypting messages (end-to-end).
- [MLS Protocol](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal): messaging Layer Security (MLS) is a security layer for encrypting messages in groups of size two to many. 
- AWS S3: for storing encrypted files.
- [Isar DB](https://github.com/isar/isar): a NoSQL database for Flutter for local data storage.
- [flutter_rust_bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/): Flutter/Dart <-> Rust binding generator, feature-rich, but seamless and simple.
- [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/): Melos is a CLI tool used to help manage Dart projects with multiple packages
- [rust-nostr](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr): Nostr protocol implementation, SDK and FFI
